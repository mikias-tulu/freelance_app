## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikias-tulu/freelance_app/main/Screenshots/mainPreview.png)

getJOBS is a mobile application designed to make the job posting and job application process as easy as possible for freelancers. With getJOBS, job seekers can quickly search for job opportunities based on their skills and location, while job posters can create job postings with all the relevant job details, including budget and required skills.

To ensure the safety of its users, getJOBS has a verification process that confirms the identity of both job posters and job seekers. The app also allows users to communicate with each other through its messaging system, which ensures that all communication is logged and can be accessed if needed.
